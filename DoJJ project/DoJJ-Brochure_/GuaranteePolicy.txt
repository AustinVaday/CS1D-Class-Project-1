We here at DoJJ Inc hold such high expectations of our product that if our robot were to shut down unexpectedly, or were to inconceivably detonate the bomb right in your face, rather than defuse it, we will immediately send a replacement with slightly upgraded software with hopes that the same event doesn't happen to you again in the future. Please note that this policy is only guaranteed for two years after purchase. After two years, the replacement policy downgrades into a simple 50% off discount on the purchase of your bomb-disposing robot.
